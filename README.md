How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring that code is functional and secure can be a challenging task. In this course, I have only done a few tests on code, and even that was a lot of work in some cases to ensure that everything works. I did not realize how involved this process was until taking this class. I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by sticking to the requirements and writing extensive tests that have a high coverage percentage. I did this in my program for this class by testing and testing until my coverage percentages were at least 90%. To ensure that the code is functional, I primarily followed the requirements. To ensure that it was secure, I wrote extensive tests based on the requirements.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by first reading them carefully and then breaking them down into specific requirements. For example, if the user needs a program that can only accept names that are no more than 10 characters long, I would first read this requirement and then break it down into two specific requirements:
* The name must not be null.
* The name must be no more than 10 characters long.

I would then incorporate these requirements into the program by using an if statement. The if statement would check if the name is null or if it is more than 10 characters long. If either of these conditions is met, the program would not accept the name. This is a basic way of translating a user need into a program. However, there are often more ambiguous requirements that require more careful analysis. For example, one program I worked on required the program to be able to add time to two separate clocks. This requirement was more ambiguous than the previous one because it did not specify how the time should be added. I would need to break down this requirement into more specific requirements before I could implement it in the program.

How do I approach designing software?
I agree that your approach to designing software could use some refinement. It is a good start to create a checklist of requirements from the requirements documents or interview transcripts. However, you can also break down the requirements into a list of objects and methods, which can help you to better understand the problem and design a more efficient solution. Once you have a good understanding of the problem, you can start writing the code. However, it is important to not only focus on making the code work, but also on making it efficient and maintainable. You can do this by using design patterns and by writing unit tests. Finally, it is important to get feedback on your design from other developers. This can help you to identify any potential problems and to improve your design.
